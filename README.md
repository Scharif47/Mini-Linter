# Mini-Linter
A solution to Codeacademy's Mini Linter challenge.

This is the same type of work that word processing software does. Additionally, you may have heard of linting, a process by which text is evaluated and improved by an application. In this project, you will create a miniature version of a linter using array methods that you have learned.
